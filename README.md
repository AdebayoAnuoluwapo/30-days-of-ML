30 days of ML is a challenge where 6 people are learning ML and Deep learning by working on real world projects.
The two books used are:
  1. [O'reilly Sklearn book](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/cm-oreilly-chapter-machine-learning-analyst-paper-f20000-201910-en.pdf)
  2. [Hands son Deep Learning with Tensorflow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-96MxtTvh6ceFnP2s7l4TrWWvEx3iaLz/view)


At the end of the 30 days of ML, we'll deploy our model to a website.
